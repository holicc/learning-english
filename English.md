# Thirteen equlas one

Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years age and has been silent ever since.

One night, however, our vicar woken up with a start: the clock was struck the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught a sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill, Wikins, our local grocer.

"Whatever are you doing here, Bill" asked the vicar in surprise. "I'm tring to repair the bell," answered Bill, "I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now, You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise." "You certainly did give me a surprise." said the vicar, "You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again." "That's the trouble, vicar." answered Bill, "It's working all right, but I'm afarid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."

"We will get used to it, Bill." said the vicar, "Thirteen as not good as one, but better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea."

# An unknown goddess

Some time age, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses, often three storeys hight, were build of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped a drainage system, for a many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as one place of worship from the 15th century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of 15 statues were found. Each of there represented a goddess and had, at one time, been planted.

The body of one statue was found among remains dating from 15th century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the 5th century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very moderm-looking women. She stood three foot high, and her hands resetd on her hips.

She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her indentity.

# The double life of Alfred Bloggs

These days, people who do manual work often far more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'White-collar worker' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to scarified higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.

When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporaction. Every monring, he left home dreesed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spend eight hourse as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that sha married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found out another job. He will soon be working in office. He will be earning half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr Bloggs' not 'Alf'.

# The facts

Editors of newspaper and magazines often go to extremes to provide thire readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazin to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began "Hundreds of steps lead to the hight wall which surrouds the president's palace." The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him to find out the extract number of steps and the height of the wall.

The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but he took a long time to send them. Meanwhile the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He send the journalist two more faxes, but received no more reply. He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received the fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prsion as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that he had been arrested while counting the 1084 steps leading to the fiteen-foot wall which surrouds the president's palace.



# Mutilated Ladies

Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers into the washing meachine and then remember there was a large note in your back pocket? When you rescured your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? Pepole who live in Britain needn't despair when they make misstakes like this(and a lot of pepole do) Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a mechine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!

A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiance, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing 3 thousands pounds into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went to horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiance's wallet as well. Image their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and money to the special departmenet of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. "So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back" said a spokeswoman of the Bank, "Last year, we paid 1.5 m pounds on 21000 calims"
