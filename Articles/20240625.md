# Smash and grab

The expensive shop in famous arcade near Picadilly were just opening. At this time of morning, the arcade almost empty. Mr. Taylor the own of jewellery shop was admiring the new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond and necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of back velvet. After gazing the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.

The silence was suddely broken, when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a shop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces, jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on. Mr Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves stuck by a heavy statue, but he was too bussy to helping himself diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the man scrambled back into the car and moved off at fantistic speed. Just as it was levaing, Mr. Tarlor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossiable to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds wroth of diamonds.
