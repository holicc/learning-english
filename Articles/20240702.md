# A famous monastery

The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2,473 metres, it is highest mountain in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, Which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers corssing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. Now that a tunnel have been built throught the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenerver a traveller is in difficulty. Desipte the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot. 

During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who corss the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quiet different. The temperature drops to -30 and very few people attempt to corss the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom too, for they are allowed to wander outside the their enclosure. The only regular visitor to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there to Chrismas and Easter. These young people who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome of St. Bernard's monastery.
